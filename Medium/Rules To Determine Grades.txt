Find the rules used to determine each grade. Show the rule in a separate column in the format of 'Score > X AND Score <= Y => Grade = A' where X and Y are the lower and upper bounds for a grade. Output the corresponding grade and its highest and lowest scores along with the rule. Order the result based on the grade in ascending order.





SOLUTION:

SELECT
    *,
    CONCAT('Score > ', min - 1, ' AND Score <= ', max, ' => GRADE = ', grade) rule
FROM 
(
SELECT
    grade,
    MIN(score) min,
    MAX(score) max
FROM los_angeles_restaurant_health_inspections
GROUP BY grade
) t1
