SOLUTION:

WITH
transactions_by_users AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        created_at
    FROM amazon_transactions
    GROUP BY user_id, created_at, revenue
    ORDER BY user_id, created_at
),
compared_transactions AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        lag(created_at) OVER(partition by user_id) last_transaction
    FROM transactions_by_users
),
transactions_difference AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        DATEDIFF(created_at, last_transaction) difference
    FROM compared_transactions 
)

SELECT distinct user_id FROM transactions_difference WHERE difference <= 7  ORDER by user_id






DB:

amazon_transactions
id		int
user_id		int
itemvar		char
created_at	datetime
