Meta/Facebook Messenger stores the number of messages between users in a table named 'fb_messages'. 
In this table 'user1' is the sender, 'user2' is the receiver, and 'msg_count' is the number of messages exchanged between them.
Find the top 10 most active users on Meta/Facebook Messenger by counting their total number of messages sent and received. 
Your solution should output usernames and the count of the total messages they sent or received





SOLUTION:

WITH
received AS (
    SELECT
        user2,
        SUM(msg_count) total_received
    FROM fb_messages
    GROUP BY 1
),
sent AS (
    SELECT 
        user1,
        SUM(msg_count) total_sent
    FROM fb_messages
    GROUP BY 1 
),
union_table AS (
    (SELECT * FROM received) UNION (SELECT * FROM sent)
)

SELECT
    user2 username,     
    SUM(total_received) total 
FROM union_table
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10
