Find the number of orders, the number of customers, and the total cost of orders for each city. 
Only include cities that have made at least 5 orders and count all customers in each city even if they did not place an order.

Output each calculation along with the corresponding city name





SOLUTION:

WITH
city_list AS (
    SELECT c.city
    FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o. cust_id
    GROUP BY c.city HAVING COUNT(1) >= 5
),
customers_count AS (
    SELECT c.city, COUNT(1) customers_count FROM city_list cl RIGHT JOIN customers c ON cl.city = c.city
    WHERE c.city IN (SELECT * FROM city_list)
    GROUP BY c.city
),
orders_count AS (
    SELECT c.city, COUNT(1) orders_count, SUM(o.total_order_cost) orders_cost
    FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.cust_id
    WHERE city IN (SELECT * FROM city_list)
    GROUP BY c.city
)
SELECT 
    cc.city, 
    oc.orders_count,
    cc.customers_count,
    oc.orders_cost
FROM orders_count oc JOIN customers_count cc ON oc.city = cc.city
