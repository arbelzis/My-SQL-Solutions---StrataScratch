Given a list of projects and employees mapped to each project, calculate by the amount of project budget allocated to each employee . 
The output should include the project title and the project budget per employee rounded to the closest integer. 
Order your list by projects with the highest budget per employee first.





SOLUTION:

WITH 
employee_count AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        COUNT(*) OVER (partition by p.id) employees
    FROM ms_projects p JOIN ms_emp_projects e ON p.id = e.project_id
    ORDER BY p.id
)
SELECT
    DISTINCT
    title,
    CEIL(budget/employees) budget_per_employee
FROM employee_count
ORDER BY budget_per_employee DESC





DB:

ms_projects
id		int
title		varchar
budget		int

ms_emp_projects
emp_id		int
project_id	int
