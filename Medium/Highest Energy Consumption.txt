Output the date along with the total energy consumption across all data centers.





SOLUTION:
WITH 
unioned_consumption AS (
    SELECT date, consumption FROM fb_eu_energy
    UNION
    SELECT date, consumption FROM fb_asia_energy
    UNION 
    SELECT date, consumption FROM fb_na_energy
),
grouped_by_date AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        SUM(consumption) as total_consumption
    FROM unioned_consumption
    GROUP BY date
),
max_consumption AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        total_consumption,
        MAX(total_consumption) OVER() max_consumption
    FROM grouped_by_date
)

SELECT
    date,
    total_consumption
FROM max_consumption
WHERE total_consumption = max_consumption
