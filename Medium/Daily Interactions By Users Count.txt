SOLUTION:

WITH
user_involved AS (
    SELECT day, COUNT(1) n_people
    FROM (
        SELECT day, user1 FROM facebook_user_interactions
        UNION
        SELECT day, user2 FROM facebook_user_interactions
    ) x
    GROUP BY day
),
intercations AS (
    SELECT
        day,
        COUNT(1) n_interactions
    FROM facebook_user_interactions
    GROUP BY day
)
SELECT 
    u.day, 
    i.n_interactions, 
    u.n_people 
FROM intercations i JOIN user_involved u ON i.day = u.day
ORDER BY  i.n_interactions ASC, u.n_people DESC





DB:

facebook_user_interactions
day		int
user1		int
user2		int
