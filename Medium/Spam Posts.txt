Calculate the percentage of spam posts in all viewed posts by day. 
A post is considered a spam if a string "spam" is inside keywords of the post. 
Note that the facebook_posts table stores all posts posted by users. 
The facebook_post_views table is an action table denoting if a user has viewed a post.





SOLUTION:

WITH
viewed_posts AS (
    SELECT
        p.post_date, p.post_keywords
    FROM facebook_posts p RIGHT JOIN facebook_post_views pv ON p.post_id = pv.post_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
times_spam AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        COUNT(*) OVER(partition by post_date) times
    FROM viewed_posts
),
spam_only AS (
    SELECT
        *
    FROM times_spam
    WHERE post_keywords LIKE '%spam%'
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    post_date,
    100 / times
FROM spam_only
