For each guest reviewer, find the nationality of the reviewer’s favorite host based on the guest’s highest review score given to a host. 
Output the user ID of the guest along with their favorite host’s nationality.

Both the `from_user` and `to_user` columns are user IDs.





SOLUTION:

WITH
guests_reviews AS (
    SELECT * FROM airbnb_reviews WHERE from_type = 'guest'
),
joined AS (
    SELECT from_user, h.host_id, r.review_score, h.nationality
    FROM guests_reviews r JOIN airbnb_hosts h ON r.to_user = h.host_id
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT *, RANK() OVER(partition by from_user ORDER BY review_score DESC) rnk
    FROM joined
)

SELECT 
    from_user,
    nationality
FROM ranked
WHERE rnk = 1
GROUP BY from_user, nationality
