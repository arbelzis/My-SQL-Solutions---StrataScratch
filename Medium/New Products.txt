You are given a table of product launches by company by year. 
Write a query to count the net difference between the number of products companies launched in 2020 for the first time with the number of products companies launched in the previous year. 
Output the name of the companies and a net difference of net products released for 2020 compared to the previous year. 
If a company is new or had no products in 2019, then any product released in 2020 would be considered as new.

        year,
        COUNT(*)
    FROM car_launches
    WHERE year = 2019
    GROUP BY company_name
),
2020_products AS (
    SELECT
        company_name,
        year,
        COUNT(*) products
    FROM car_launches
    WHERE year = 2020
    GROUP BY company_name
),
mixed_years AS (
    SELECT * FROM 2020_products
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM 2019_products
    ORDER BY company_name, year DESC
),
compared AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        lead(products) OVER(partition by company_name) last_year
    FROM mixed_years
)
SELECT
    company_name,
    products - last_year
FROM compared
WHERE year = 2020
