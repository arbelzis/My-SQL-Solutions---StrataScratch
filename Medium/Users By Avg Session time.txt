Calculate each user's average session time. 
A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
For simplicity, assume an user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events in that day, 
consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. 
Output the user_id and their average 





SOLUTION:

WITH
exit_and_load AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(timestamp) day,
        MAX(CASE WHEN action = 'page_exit' THEN timestamp END) as exit_page,
        MAX(CASE WHEN action = 'page_load' THEN timestamp END) as load_page
    FROM facebook_web_log
    GROUP BY user_id, date(timestamp)
    ORDER BY user_id, day
),
user_and_session AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(exit_page, load_page)) session
    FROM exit_and_load
    WHERE exit_page IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    AVG(session) AS average_session
FROM user_and_session
GROUP BY user_id





DB:

facebook_web_log
user_id			int
timestampd		datetime
action			varchar
