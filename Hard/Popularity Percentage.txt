Find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.
Output each user along with their popularity percentage. Order records in ascending order by user id.
The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.

),
total_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        COUNT(user1)
    FROM ((SELECT user1 FROM facebook_friends)
    UNION
    (SELECT user2 FROM facebook_friends)) t1
)
SELECT
    user1,
    (COUNT(1) / (SELECT * FROM total_users))* 100 percentage
FROM breakdown
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
