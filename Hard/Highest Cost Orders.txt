Find the customer with the highest daily total order cost between 2019-02-01 to 2019-05-01. If customer had more than one order on a certain day, sum the order costs on daily basis. Output their first name, total cost of their items, and the date.
 
 For simplicity, you can assume that every first name in the dataset is unique.





SOLUTION:

SELECT
    first_name,
    order_date,
    SUM(total_order_cost) total
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        c.id, c.first_name,
        o.order_date,
        o.total_order_cost
    FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.cust_id
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'
) t1
GROUP BY id, order_date
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1
