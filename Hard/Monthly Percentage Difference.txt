Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.





SOLUTION:

SELECT
    date,
    ROUND((month_total - last_month) / last_month * 100, 2) diff_perc
FROM
(
    SELECT
        date, month_total,
        lag(month_total) OVER(ORDER BY date) last_month
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') date,
            SUM(value) month_total
        FROM sf_transactions
        GROUP BY 1
    ) t1
) t2






DB:

sf_transactions
id		int
created_at	datetime
value		int
purchase_id	int
